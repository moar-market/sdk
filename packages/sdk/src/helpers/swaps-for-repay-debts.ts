/**
 * Calculates the required swaps to repay all outstanding debts using available surpluses.
 *
 * For each token with remaining debt, attempts to use available surpluses from other tokens
 * to generate swap previews that can cover the debt. If a surplus is sufficient to fully
 * repay a debt, a single swap is created. If not, as much debt as possible is repaid with
 * the available surplus, and the process continues with other surpluses.
 *
 * If any debt remains unresolved after exhausting all surpluses, a warning is logged.
 *
 * @param params - Parameters for swap calculation.
 * @param params.tokens - List of tokens with their debt and surplus information.
 * @param params.toAddress - Address to receive swapped tokens. Defaults to zero address.
 * @param params.slippage - Slippage tolerance for swaps. Defaults to 0.2.
 * @param params.includeSources - List of swap sources to include.
 * @param params.excludeSources - List of swap sources to exclude.
 * @param params.preview_swap_exact - Function to preview swap quotes. Defaults to the dex_swap preview_swap_exact.
 * @returns Promise resolving to an array of CommonSwapPreview objects representing the swaps needed to repay debts.
